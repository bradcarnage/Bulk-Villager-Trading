Bulk Villager Trading. Automatically Re-Stocks the trade UI after shift-click.

Manually clicking the trade button over and over again can be exhausting, tiring, and downright frustrating and slow.

 

Using this mod [**___can reduce onset of carpal tunnel syndrome___**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome), and is a significantly better change compared to the vanilla behaviour when trying to bulk trade.

This mod *_simply re-stocks the Trade UI_* when you shift-click complete a trade, so you can trade more items. This mod is considered ___**light automation**___, similar to macros, and is only needed on the client. It is compatible with most servers, so please ask administrators or moderators where you play.

 

This mod is currently only for forge, as I have been able to find similar mods for the fabric modloader.
